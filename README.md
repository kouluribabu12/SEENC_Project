   # ABSTRACT
In today's society, data security is a major concern. When a person
transmits a secret message to a recipient, there are numerous ways for
third parties to get access to the communication. When it comes to safely
transmitting messages, cryptography is crucial.
Asymmetric cryptography is used in many applications to secure
communications between two parties. The necessity for massive quantities
of compute and storage is one of the key challenges with asymmetric
cryptography. This project use elliptical curve cryptography to address
these issues.
Elliptic Curve cryptography is a public key cryptographic system in which
the sender's private key is used to encrypt the message, and the sender's
public key and the receiver's private key are used to decrypt it. When
compared to other cryptographic approaches, ECC gives higher security
with a smaller key size. As a result, this can be used in electronic gadgets
that have less memory and consume less power. The text encryption will
be double-secured thanks to the mapping technique's security.
To ensure safe communications, the ECC must have a strong
implementation, especially when encoding a message to an elliptic curve.
It's also critical for the ECC to protect the mapping of the message to the
encryption curve. The goal of this project is to provide a trusted and
proofed technique that uses authenticated encryption (AE) for both
encoding and curve mapping. In addition, this study presents analytical
results comparing the proposed scheme's security criteria to a variety of
encryption approaches.
# ENCRYPTION :
Encryption is the process of encoding information in cryptography.This
process converts the original information representation, known as
plaintext, into an alternate form known as ciphertext. Only authorised
parties should be able to decipher ciphertext back to plaintext and access
the original information. Because senders use an encryption algorithm, a
hacker cannot read the data.Encryption is now used in the transfer of data
over the Internet for security and commerce. Computer encryption is
constantly evolving to prevent attacks as computing power
increases.Encryption is typically accomplished through the use of key
algorithms.

# DECRYPTION :
Decryption is the process of converting encrypted data back to its
original form. In general, it is a reverse encryption process. Because
decryption requires a secret key or password, it decodes the encrypted
information so that only an authorised user can decrypt the data.
Privacy is one of the reasons for implementing an encryption-decryption
system.
As data travels over the Internet, it is necessary to monitor access from unauthorized organisations or individuals. As a result, the data is encrypted to prevent data loss and theft. Text files, images, e-mail messages, user data, and directories are all examples of commonly encrypted items. To access the encrypted data, the recipient of decryption is presented with a prompt or window in which a password can be entered. For decryption, the system extracts and converts the garbled data, transforming it into words and images that anyone, not just a reader, can understand.

A Data Confidentiality, Data Integrity, Authentication and Non-repudiation are core principles of modern-day cryptography.
1) Confidentiality refers to the rules and principles that are normally followed under confidentiality agreements to keep information restricted to specified people or locations. Anyone who wasn't supposed to get the knowledge will find it unintelligible.
2) Data integrity refers to the upkeep and assurance of accurate and consistent data throughout its life cycle.
3) Authentication is the process of ascertaining if the data claimed by the user is, in fact, its own.
4) The capacity to ensure that a person or party participating in a contract or communication cannot reject the authenticity of their signature on a document or 
the transmission of a message is referred to as non-repudiation.
