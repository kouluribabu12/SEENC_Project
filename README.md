   # ABSTRACT
In today's society, data security is a major concern. When a person
transmits a secret message to a recipient, there are numerous ways for
third parties to get access to the communication. When it comes to safely
transmitting messages, cryptography is crucial.
Asymmetric cryptography is used in many applications to secure
communications between two parties. The necessity for massive quantities
of compute and storage is one of the key challenges with asymmetric
cryptography. This project use elliptical curve cryptography to address
these issues.
Elliptic Curve cryptography is a public key cryptographic system in which
the sender's private key is used to encrypt the message, and the sender's
public key and the receiver's private key are used to decrypt it. When
compared to other cryptographic approaches, ECC gives higher security
with a smaller key size. As a result, this can be used in electronic gadgets
that have less memory and consume less power. The text encryption will
be double-secured thanks to the mapping technique's security.
To ensure safe communications, the ECC must have a strong
implementation, especially when encoding a message to an elliptic curve.
It's also critical for the ECC to protect the mapping of the message to the
encryption curve. The goal of this project is to provide a trusted and
proofed technique that uses authenticated encryption (AE) for both
encoding and curve mapping. In addition, this study presents analytical
results comparing the proposed scheme's security criteria to a variety of
encryption approaches.
# ENCRYPTION :
Encryption is the process of encoding information in cryptography.This
process converts the original information representation, known as
plaintext, into an alternate form known as ciphertext. Only authorised
parties should be able to decipher ciphertext back to plaintext and access
the original information. Because senders use an encryption algorithm, a
hacker cannot read the data.Encryption is now used in the transfer of data
over the Internet for security and commerce. Computer encryption is
constantly evolving to prevent attacks as computing power
increases.Encryption is typically accomplished through the use of key
algorithms.

# DECRYPTION :
Decryption is the process of converting encrypted data back to its
original form. In general, it is a reverse encryption process. Because
decryption requires a secret key or password, it decodes the encrypted
information so that only an authorised user can decrypt the data.
Privacy is one of the reasons for implementing an encryption-decryption
system.
