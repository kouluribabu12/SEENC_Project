In today's society, data security is a major concern. When a person
transmits a secret message to a recipient, there are numerous ways for
third parties to get access to the communication. When it comes to safely
transmitting messages, cryptography is crucial.
Asymmetric cryptography is used in many applications to secure
communications between two parties. The necessity for massive quantities
of compute and storage is one of the key challenges with asymmetric
cryptography. This project use elliptical curve cryptography to address
these issues.
Elliptic Curve cryptography is a public key cryptographic system in which
the sender's private key is used to encrypt the message, and the sender's
public key and the receiver's private key are used to decrypt it. When
compared to other cryptographic approaches, ECC gives higher security
with a smaller key size. As a result, this can be used in electronic gadgets
that have less memory and consume less power. The text encryption will
be double-secured thanks to the mapping technique's security.
To ensure safe communications, the ECC must have a strong
implementation, especially when encoding a message to an elliptic curve.
It's also critical for the ECC to protect the mapping of the message to the
encryption curve. The goal of this project is to provide a trusted and
proofed technique that uses authenticated encryption (AE) for both
encoding and curve mapping. In addition, this study presents analytical
results comparing the proposed scheme's security criteria to a variety of
encryption approaches.
